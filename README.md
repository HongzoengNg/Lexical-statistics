# Lexical-statistics
A simple program(C++) for counting the number of identified words in a PL/0 source code.

Attention:
1\Key words used to declare a variety should only be "Var","Const".The first letter should be capitalized.
2\We can change the comments to make output content into a ".txt" file.
3\This program is just adaptive to PL/0 source code statistics.
4\Files like "input.txt" can be used to test the statistics results.
